# Experiment! Super early stages!

Imagine an API docsite generator that generates something like http://pkg.go.dev but:

* Works with any language
* Has symbol-level search
* Automatically surfaces usage examples
* Supports both private code and open source

That's what [we're building here!](https://twitter.com/beyang/status/1516563075192680450)

## When can I try it?

If you'd like to try it out once we have an early version, let us know [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/beyang/status/1516563075192680450) or open an issue - we'd love people to try it out as we develop it!

Actual project README begins here :)
