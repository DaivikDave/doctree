* Elm frontend
  * UI design (there is none yet!)
    * Project pages look quite scary! Need search here?
  * Right now, "go" is hard-coded in the URL. Need to fix this and figure out how to merge multiple languages in the same project into one page, etc.
  * Auto-index projects previously `doctree add .`'d (watch for changes)
  * Only show exported symbols by default, add "filters" or "tags" to schema
  * Linking to sections should be possible
  * Viewing root (top level) Go packages doesn't work ("." recorded as path by indexer?)
  * "Package graphqlbackend" should be accompanied by it's description (not full detail) in schema.
* Go indexer
  * should fully implement schema / be a role model
  * snapshot tests!
  * Comment strings show `//` before them.
  * `//go:` directives should be stripped out
  * `//go:build` directives are not respected, e.g. `func Fuzz(data []byte)` in encoding/json.
  * Some function signatures not working: http://localhost:3333/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/-/go/-/cmd/frontend/graphqlbackend
  * Should track packages by path+pkgName, not pkgName (e.g. multiple `main` packages are "merged")
  * Methods
  * Variables
  * Constants
  * `func _()` appears in http://localhost:3333/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/-/go/-/cmd/searcher/protocol
